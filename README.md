# LangGraph Feedback Classifier Chatbot

This project is a **feedback-classifying chatbot** that uses **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google GenAI)** to identify whether user input is *positive* or *negative*, and respond accordingly.

---

## ðŸ§  Features

- Classifies messages as either:
  - `"positive"` â€“ sends a friendly reply.
  - `"negative"` â€“ stores a response for both user and boss in `issue.txt`.
- Uses structured output parsing with `Pydantic`.
- Employs a LangGraph stateful flow to direct logic.

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install langgraph langchain pydantic
```

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
   ```

2. **Run the chatbot**:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

3. **Interact**:
   ```

   ```

4. **Exit**:
   ```
   Message: exit

## ðŸ“‚ File Outputs

- When a **negative** message is received, the chatbot:
  - Responds to the user.
  - Extracts a `boss_message` and saves it in `issue.txt`.
